# RedCross

During natural disasters such as a flood the Red Cross works to provide actionable information as well as provide services to people who were displaced. The data that they collect is not as precise as they would like and getting this information can sometimes take longer than they would want. For example, knowing exactly which houses are effected is not information that is readily available. This team will be tasked with creating a structure which can rapidly collect.
